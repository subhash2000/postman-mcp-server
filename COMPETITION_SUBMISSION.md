Hey everyone! üëã

I'm excited to share my submission for the "Build an App for Just You" challenge - an **AI Research Assistant MCP Server** that's completely transformed how I handle my daily research.

## The Story Behind It

As someone who's constantly trying to keep up with the latest in AI and tech, I found myself drowning in research papers every morning. I'd spend 2-3 hours jumping between CrossRef, arXiv, and Google Scholar, then copying abstracts into ChatGPT just to understand what they were about. It was honestly exhausting and I was missing so many important papers.

So I built this MCP server that integrates directly with Claude Desktop. Now I can just ask: *"Hey, find me some recent papers on transformer architectures and give me the key takeaways"* - and boom, I get exactly what I need in minutes instead of hours.

## What I Built With Postman

I used Postman's MCP Generator to create the server foundation, integrated the CrossRef API from their Public API Network for academic search, and connected OpenAI's API for intelligent summarization. I've also included a Postman Collection so you can see exactly how everything works together.

The best part? This has genuinely changed my daily routine. What used to be a 3-hour research slog is now a quick 30-minute conversation with my AI assistant. I'm actually excited about research time now instead of dreading it!

## Check It Out

- **GitHub**: https://github.com/subhash2000/postman-mcp-server
- **Demo Video**: Coming soon!
- **Postman Collection**: Available in the repo

I know this was built specifically for my workflow, but I think any researcher or developer who struggles with information overload might find it helpful too.

Thanks for considering my submission! üôè
